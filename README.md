This is my practice of making applications in Swift.
I read [an introductory book published by Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/book/app-development-with-swift/id1209648719?mt=11&v0=www-jp-education-everyone-can-code-book-app-development-swift-preview)
, and I made an easy app using skills I learned from this book.
